Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ria and I am a software engineer passionate about building user-friendly apps for social good. ðŸ‘¥

Professionally, I've gotten to design software at NASA to teach the world about our planet, as well as at an HPC center whose research tools are used by Harvard, JHU, and many more. ðŸš€

Personally, I've worked on an AI-powered journal app designed to help you track your mental health trends, as well as an app to help connect budding engineers with teammates to design the next world-changing projects. I've also created apps to help college students find the best spots on campus for dining and studying, as well as a website to bring high school students together at school spirit events. ðŸ§ 

Academically, I've graduated at the top of my class as a Presidential Scholar with a B.S. in Computer Science (focus on Software and Information Systems and Machine Learning) and a minor in Mathematics. I've also been a teaching assistant for Intro to CS and Internet & Society, and in 3D Game Design, where I also got to project manage teams in their Unreal Engine game development processes. I've conducted research in both Programming Languages/Compilers and Swarm Robotics (in which I co-authored an AAAI Bridge paper). ðŸ“š

I'd love to connect with you and collaborate on a new idea! âœ¨
